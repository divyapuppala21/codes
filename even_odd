Even or odd
Here’s the database table you’ll use in this challenge:
id    value
1      4
2      11
3      57
4      24
5      47
Your job is to return whether or not the number in the Value column is even or odd rather than returning the number itself. Your query should return the following values:
the output is like:
=======================
even, odd, odd, even, odd


SQL QUERY
=========

SELECT 
    id,
    CASE 
        WHEN Value % 2 = 0 THEN 'even'
        ELSE 'odd'
    END AS EvenOrOdd
FROM 
    your_table_name;
